## What is DingTimer?

DingTimer is a **leveling efficiency addon** that answers the eternal question every grinder has asked: *"How long until I ding?"*

No more alt-tabbing to calculators. No more rough guesses. DingTimer tracks your XP gains in real time, calculates your XP/hr using a rolling time window, and tells you exactly how long that last level is going to take — all from inside the game.

**It also tracks your gold.** Because gold per hour is just as important as XP per hour.

---

## Features

- **XP Per Hour** — Rolling-window calculation that adapts to your current pace, not your average from an hour ago
- **Time To Level (TTL)** — Live countdown to your next ding, updated every second
- **Money Per Hour** — Track your gold income alongside your XP gains
- **XP Graph** — Visual bar chart showing your XP/hr over time with trend coloring and a session average overlay
- **Floating Text** — A sleek HUD element showing TTL and XP/hr at all times
- **Stats Window** — A full dashboard with all six tracked metrics in one place
- **Settings Window** — GUI for all options, no slash command memorization required
- **Minimap Button** — Left-click for stats, right-click for settings, drag to reposition
- **Level-Up Announcements** — Celebrates every ding with your time in level and gold earned
- **Persistent Sessions** — All settings and window positions saved between sessions

---

## Slash Commands

All commands work with either `/ding` or `/dt`.

### Core

| Command                 | What it does                                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `/ding`                 | Show the help menu                            |
| `/ding help <command>`  | Detailed help for a specific command          |
| `/ding ui`              | Toggle the stats window                       |
| `/ding stats`           | Same as above                                 |
| `/ding settings`        | Open the settings window                      |
| `/ding reset`           | Reset current session data                    |
| `/ding on`              | Enable chat output                            |
| `/ding off`             | Disable chat output                           |

### Output Mode

| Command           | What it does                                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `/ding mode full` | Chat prints `+XP`, `XP/hr`, and `TTL` on every gain  |
| `/ding mode ttl`  | Chat prints TTL only                                  |

### Rolling Window

| Command                   | What it does                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/ding window <seconds>`  | Set the rolling window size for XP/hr calculation (minimum: 30s)  |

> **Example:** `/ding window 300` uses the last 5 minutes to calculate your XP/hr. Shorter windows react faster to pace changes; longer windows smooth out gaps.

### Float Commands

| Command             | What it does               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `/ding float on`    | Show the floating HUD      |
| `/ding float off`   | Hide the floating HUD      |
| `/ding float lock`  | Lock the HUD in place      |
| `/ding float unlock` | Allow the HUD to be dragged |

> The floating frame hides automatically during combat and reappears when combat ends.

### Graph Commands

| Command                       | What it does                                         |

| `/ding graph off`             | Hide the graph                                       |
| `/ding graph zoom <level>`    | Set the time window: `3m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, or `60m` |
| `/ding graph scale fixed`     | Y-axis locked at 100,000 XP/hr                       |
| `/ding graph scale auto`      | Y-axis scales to 110% of your current max            |
| `/ding graph lock`            | Lock graph position                                  |

## UI Breakdown

### Minimap Button

The minimap button lives on the edge of your minimap and is your primary launcher.

- **Left-click** — Open / close the Stats Window
- **Right-click** — Open / close the Settings Window
- **Drag** — Slide it anywhere around the minimap rim

You can hide it entirely from the Settings Window if you prefer slash commands.

---

### Stats Window

A compact dashboard showing a live snapshot of your session.

| Row             | What it shows                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Session Time    | How long you've been grinding this session         |
| Session XP      | Total XP earned since last reset or level-up       |
| XP Per Hour     | Your current XP/hr based on the rolling window     |
| Time To Level   | Estimated time to your next ding                   |
| Session Money   | Total gold/silver/copper earned this session       |
| Money Per Hour  | Your current gold income rate                      |

All values update every second. The window is draggable and remembers its position.

---

### Floating Text HUD

A minimal HUD that sits above your character showing:

```text
[2h 14m] to level  (47,230 XP/hr)
```

Designed to stay out of your way. Hides in combat. Drag it anywhere when unlocked.

---

### XP Graph Window

A scrolling bar chart of your XP/hr over time, updated every second.

**Bar colors:**

- **Green** — XP/hr is higher than the previous segment (you're speeding up)
- **Red** — XP/hr is lower than the previous segment (you're slowing down)
- **Gray** — No XP was gained in that segment

**The gold line** across the chart is your session-wide average XP/hr up to each point in time — a useful baseline to see whether your current pace beats your overall average.

**Hover over any bar** to see a tooltip with:

- The time range for that segment
- XP gained in that segment
- XP/hr for that segment
- Session average up to that point

**Zoom levels:** `3m` · `5m` · `15m` · `30m` · `60m`

> DingTimer retains up to 60 minutes of graph data. Switching zoom levels never loses history.

---

### Settings Window

A full GUI for all major options:

- Enable / disable chat output
- Show / hide floating text
- Lock / unlock floating text position
- Show / hide XP graph
- Hide / show minimap button
- Reset session button

---

## How XP/hr is Calculated

DingTimer uses a **rolling time window** rather than a session average. Here's why that matters:

- **Session average:** If you grinded 100k XP/hr for an hour, then went AFK for 30 minutes, your session average would show ~67k. Misleading.
- **Rolling window:** Only events within the last N seconds count. Your rate reflects what you're actually doing *right now*.

**The math:**

```text
1. Collect all XP gain events within the last [window] seconds
2. Sum the XP from those events
3. Elapsed = min(time since session start, window size)
4. XP/hr = (sum / elapsed) × 3600
```

The default window is **10 minutes (600 seconds)**. Use `/ding window <seconds>` to tune it.

---

## Level-Up Announcements

Every ding triggers a chat message with your session summary:

```text
[DingTimer] ★ LEVEL UP! ★  (Level 72)
  Time in level: 43m 17s
  Money earned:  12g 44s 3c
```

After the announcement, your session data resets automatically so your XP/hr reflects the new level.

---

## Saved Variables

DingTimer stores all data in `DingTimerDB` (saved per character). This includes:

- All settings and toggle states
- Window positions for all frames
- Current session XP and money events
- Historical sessions (last 10 kept)
- Graph data (up to 1 hour of events)
- Minimap button angle

Deleting `DingTimerDB` from your SavedVariables folder resets everything to defaults.
