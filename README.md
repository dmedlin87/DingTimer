## What is DingTimer?

DingTimer is a **leveling efficiency addon** that answers the eternal question every grinder has asked: *"How long until I ding?"*

No more alt-tabbing to calculators. No more rough guesses. DingTimer tracks your XP gains in real time, calculates your XP/hr using a rolling time window, and tells you exactly how long that last level is going to take — all from inside the game.

**It also tracks your gold.** Because gold per hour is just as important as XP per hour.

---

## Features

- **XP Per Hour** — Rolling-window calculation that adapts to your current pace, not your average from an hour ago
- **Time To Level (TTL)** — Live countdown to your next ding, updated every second
- **Money Per Hour** — Track your gold income alongside your XP gains
- **XP Graph 2.0** — Dedicated graph tab with visible/session/fixed scale modes, summary cards, grid labels, and a session average overlay
- **Session Insights** — Per-character history with best/median rates, trend tracking, and recent-session breakdowns
- **Floating HUD** — A cleaner two-line HUD showing TTL, current pace, and session pace
- **Stats Dashboard** — A richer dashboard with progress, eight live metrics, and quick-launch actions
- **Control Center** — A larger settings hub for chat, HUD, graph, and session controls
- **Minimap Button** — Left-click for dashboard, middle-click for graph, right-click for settings, drag to reposition
- **Level-Up Announcements** — Celebrates every ding with your time in level and gold earned
- **Persistent Sessions** — Settings, main window/HUD placement, and per-character session history saved between sessions

## Slash Commands

All commands work with either `/ding` or `/dt`.

### Core

| Command                 | What it does                                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `/ding`                 | Show the help menu                            |
| `/ding help <command>`  | Detailed help for a specific command          |
| `/ding ui`              | Toggle the Dashboard tab                      |
| `/ding stats`           | Same as above                                 |
| `/ding settings`        | Open the settings window                      |
| `/ding insights`        | Toggle the Session Insights window            |
| `/ding reset`           | Reset current session data                    |
| `/ding on`              | Enable chat output                            |
| `/ding off`             | Disable chat output                           |

### Output Mode

| Command           | What it does                                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `/ding mode full` | Chat prints `+XP`, `XP/hr`, and `TTL` on every gain   |
| `/ding mode ttl`  | Chat prints TTL only                                  |

### Rolling Window

| Command                   | What it does                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/ding window <seconds>`  | Set the rolling window size for XP/hr calculation without resetting the session (minimum: 30s)   |

> **Example:** `/ding window 300` uses the last 5 minutes to calculate your XP/hr. Shorter windows react faster to pace changes; longer windows smooth out gaps.

### Float Commands

| Command              | What it does                |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `/ding float on`     | Show the floating HUD       |
| `/ding float off`    | Hide the floating HUD       |
| `/ding float lock`   | Lock the HUD in place       |
| `/ding float unlock` | Allow the HUD to be dragged |

> The floating frame hides automatically during combat and reappears when combat ends.

### Graph Commands

| Command                       | What it does                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/ding graph`                 | Toggle the graph window                                 |
| `/ding graph on`              | Open the Graph tab                                      |
| `/ding graph off`             | Close the main window if the Graph tab is active        |
| `/ding graph zoom <level>`    | Set the time window: `3m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, or `60m` |
| `/ding graph scale <mode>`    | Set the Y-axis mode: `visible`, `session`, or `fixed`   |
| `/ding graph fit`             | Snap the graph back to visible-data scaling              |
| `/ding graph max <xp/hr>`     | Set the fixed Y-axis cap and switch to fixed mode        |
### Insights Commands

| Command                     | What it does                                          |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |

## UI Breakdown

### Minimap Button

The minimap button lives on the edge of your minimap and is your primary launcher.

- **Left-click** — Toggle the Dashboard tab
- **Middle-click** — Toggle the Graph tab
- **Right-click** — Toggle the Control Center tab
- **Drag** — Slide it anywhere around the minimap rim

You can hide it entirely from the Settings Window if you prefer slash commands.

---

### Stats Dashboard

A denser live dashboard showing your entire session at a glance.

- Progress header with current level XP, percent complete, and remaining XP
- Eight live metric cards: session time, session XP, current XP/hr, session average, TTL, pace delta, session money, and money/hr
- Quick-action buttons for Graph, Insights, Settings, and Reset

All values update every second. The window is draggable and remembers its position.

---

### Floating HUD

A minimal HUD that sits above your character showing:

```text
[2h 14m] to level
47,230 XP/hr  |  Session 42,801
```

Designed to stay out of your way. Hides in combat. Drag it anywhere when unlocked.

---

### XP Graph Tab

A dedicated graph tab inside the main window, updated every second while visible.

**Bar colors:**

- **Green** — XP/hr is higher than the previous segment (you're speeding up)
- **Red** — XP/hr is lower than the previous segment (you're slowing down)
- **Gray** — No XP was gained in that segment

**The gold line** across the chart is your session-wide average XP/hr up to each point in time — a useful baseline to see whether your current pace beats your overall average.

**Scale modes:**

- **Visible** — Fits the graph to the biggest bar currently on screen
- **Session** — Fits the graph to the biggest retained bar in the last 60 minutes
- **Fixed** — Uses the max XP/hr cap you set with `/ding graph max <xp/hr>`

**Header cards** show your current pace, session average, visible/session peak, and the active scale mode.

**Hover over any bar** to see a tooltip with:

- The time range for that segment
- XP gained in that segment
- XP/hr for that segment
- Session average up to that point

**Zoom levels:** `3m` · `5m` · `15m` · `30m` · `60m`

> DingTimer retains up to 60 minutes of graph data. Switching zoom levels never loses history.

---

### Session Insights Window

A dedicated analysis window for long-term improvement over multiple leveling sessions.

- Tracks history per character profile (`realm:name:class`)
- Shows median XP/hr, best XP/hr, average time in level, and trend percent
- Includes a mini trend chart built from your most recent sessions
- Lists the latest 10 sessions with level range, duration, XP/hr, money, zone, and trigger reason
- Supports history controls via `/ding insights clear` and `/ding insights keep <n>`

---

### Control Center

A larger control hub for all major options:

- Quick-open buttons for Dashboard, Graph, Insights, and Graph Reset
- Visibility toggles for chat output, floating HUD, graph, and minimap button
- Output controls for chat mode and rolling-window presets
- Graph controls for scale mode, fixed max, zoom presets, and remembered size
- Session reset with confirmation

---

## How XP/hr is Calculated

DingTimer uses a **rolling time window** rather than a session average. Here's why that matters:

- **Session average:** If you grinded 100k XP/hr for an hour, then went AFK for 30 minutes, your session average would show ~67k. Misleading.
- **Rolling window:** Only events within the last N seconds count. Your rate reflects what you're actually doing *right now*.

**The math:**

```text
1. Collect all XP gain events within the last [window] seconds
2. Sum the XP from those events
3. Elapsed = min(time since session start, window size)
4. XP/hr = (sum / elapsed) × 3600
```

The default window is **10 minutes (600 seconds)**. Use `/ding window <seconds>` to tune it.

---

## Level-Up Announcements

Every ding triggers a chat message with your session summary:

```text
[DingTimer] ★ LEVEL UP! ★  (Level 72)
  Time in level: 43m 17s
  Money earned:  12g 44s 3c
```

After the announcement, your session data resets automatically so your XP/hr reflects the new level.

---

## Saved Variables

DingTimer stores all data in the account-wide `DingTimerDB` SavedVariable. Session history is bucketed per character profile inside that database. This includes:

- All settings and toggle states
- Main window and floating HUD positions
- Historical sessions per character profile (last 30 kept by default)
- Graph presentation settings (zoom, scale mode, fixed max)
- Minimap button angle

Deleting `DingTimerDB` from your SavedVariables folder resets everything to defaults.
