## What is DingTimer?

DingTimer is a **leveling efficiency addon** that answers the eternal question every grinder has asked: *"How long until I ding?"*

No more alt-tabbing to calculators. No more rough guesses. DingTimer tracks your XP gains in real time, calculates your XP/hr using a rolling time window, and tells you exactly how long that last level is going to take — all from inside the game.

**It also tracks your gold, Honor, and HKs.** Gold per hour matters while leveling, and Honor/HKs matter when you flip into PvP mode.

---

## Features

- **XP Per Hour** — Rolling-window calculation that adapts to your current pace, not your average from an hour ago
- **Time To Level (TTL)** — Live countdown to your next ding, updated every second
- **Money Per Hour** — Track your gold income alongside your XP gains
- **Honor + HK Tracking** — Dedicated PvP mode for Honor/hr, HK/hr, session Honor, session HKs, and time-to-cap or custom Honor goals
- **Session Coach** — Goal presets, pace-drop alerts, idle nudges, best-segment callouts, and end-of-run recap
- **Analysis Graph** — Dedicated graph view with visible/session/fixed scale modes, summary cards, goal comparisons, and recent segment rows
- **History View** — Per-character leveling and PvP history with best/median rates, trend tracking, recap storage, and recent-session breakdowns
- **Floating HUD** — A cleaner two-line HUD that swaps between leveling TTL and PvP TTG based on the active mode
- **Live Panel** — A refreshed home view for progress, status, notices, and quick actions in both leveling and PvP modes
- **Settings Hub** — Grouped controls for output, HUD, coach, graph, PvP, and data maintenance
- **Minimap Button** — Left-click for Live, right-click for Analysis, middle-click for Settings, drag to reposition
- **Level-Up Announcements** — Celebrates every ding with your time in level and gold earned
- **Persistent Sessions** — Settings, main window/HUD placement, and per-character session history saved between sessions

### Output Mode

| Command           | What it does                                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `/ding mode full` | Chat prints `+XP`, `XP/hr`, and `TTL` on every gain   |
| `/ding mode ttl`  | Chat prints TTL only                                  |

### Rolling Window

| Command                   | What it does                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/ding window <seconds>`  | Set the rolling window size for XP/hr calculation without resetting the session (minimum: 30s)   |

> **Example:** `/ding window 300` uses the last 5 minutes to calculate your XP/hr. Shorter windows react faster to pace changes; longer windows smooth out gaps.

| `/ding graph off`             | Close the main window if the Analysis tab is active     |
| `/ding graph zoom <level>`    | Set the time window: `3m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, or `60m` |

## UI Breakdown

### Minimap Button

The minimap button lives on the edge of your minimap and is your primary launcher.

- **Left-click** — Open the Live tab
- **Right-click** — Open the Analysis tab
- **Middle-click** — Open the Settings tab
- **Drag** — Slide it anywhere around the minimap rim

You can hide it entirely from the Settings tab if you prefer slash commands.

---

### Live Panel

A denser live dashboard showing your entire session at a glance.

- Progress header with current level XP, percent complete, and remaining XP
- Eight live metric cards: session time, session XP, current XP/hr, session average, TTL, pace delta, session money, and money/hr
- Quick-action buttons for Graph, Insights, Settings, and Reset

When PvP mode is active, the same panel swaps to Honor progress, Honor/hr, session Honor, session HKs, HK/hr, goal state, and active battleground status.

All values update every second. The window is draggable and remembers its position.

---

### Floating HUD

A minimal HUD that sits above your character showing:

```text
[2h 14m] to level
47,230 XP/hr  |  Session 42,801
```

Designed to stay out of your way. Hides in combat. Drag it anywhere when unlocked.

When PvP mode is active, the HUD swaps to your current Honor goal or cap ETA plus Honor/hr and session Honor.

---

### XP Graph Tab

A dedicated graph tab inside the main window, updated every second while visible.

**Bar colors:**

- **Green** — XP/hr is higher than the previous segment (you're speeding up)
- **Red** — XP/hr is lower than the previous segment (you're slowing down)
- **Gray** — No XP was gained in that segment

**The gold line** across the chart is your session-wide average XP/hr up to each point in time — a useful baseline to see whether your current pace beats your overall average.

**Scale modes:**

- **Visible** — Fits the graph to the biggest bar currently on screen
- **Session** — Fits the graph to the biggest retained bar in the last 60 minutes
- **Fixed** — Uses the max XP/hr cap you set with `/ding graph max <xp/hr>`

**Header cards** show your current pace, session average, visible/session peak, and the active scale mode.

**Hover over any bar** to see a tooltip with:

- The time range for that segment
- XP gained in that segment
- XP/hr for that segment
- Session average up to that point

**Zoom levels:** `3m` · `5m` · `15m` · `30m` · `60m`

> DingTimer retains up to 60 minutes of graph data. Switching zoom levels never loses history.

---

### Session Insights Window

A dedicated analysis window for long-term improvement over multiple leveling sessions.

The History tab also has a PvP view for session-level Honor/HK analysis and recap review.

- Tracks history per character profile (`realm:name:class`)
- Shows median XP/hr, best XP/hr, average time in level, and trend percent
- Includes a mini trend chart built from your most recent sessions
- Lists the latest 10 sessions with level range, duration, XP/hr, money, zone, and trigger reason
- Supports history controls via `/ding insights clear` and `/ding insights keep <n>`

---

### Settings Tab

A larger control hub for all major options:

- Quick-open buttons for History, keep-retention presets, graph scaling, and session maintenance
- Visibility toggles for chat output, floating HUD, and minimap button
- Output controls for chat mode and rolling-window presets
- Graph controls for scale mode, fixed max, and zoom presets
- PvP controls for mode toggling, Honor goals, battleground auto-switching, and local recap/milestone notices
- Session reset with confirmation

---

## How XP/hr is Calculated

DingTimer uses a **rolling time window** rather than a session average. Here's why that matters:

- **Session average:** If you grinded 100k XP/hr for an hour, then went AFK for 30 minutes, your session average would show ~67k. Misleading.
- **Rolling window:** Only events within the last N seconds count. Your rate reflects what you're actually doing *right now*.

**The math:**

```text
1. Collect all XP gain events within the last [window] seconds
2. Sum the XP from those events
3. Elapsed = min(time since session start, window size)
4. XP/hr = (sum / elapsed) × 3600
```

The default window is **10 minutes (600 seconds)**. Use `/ding window <seconds>` to tune it.

---

## Level-Up Announcements

Every ding triggers a chat message with your session summary:

```text
[DingTimer] ★ LEVEL UP! ★  (Level 72)
  Time in level: 43m 17s
  Money earned:  12g 44s 3c
```

After the announcement, your session data resets automatically so your XP/hr reflects the new level.

---

## Saved Variables

DingTimer stores all data in the account-wide `DingTimerDB` SavedVariable. Session history is bucketed per character profile inside that database. This includes:

- All settings and toggle states
- Main window and floating HUD positions
- Historical sessions per character profile (last 30 kept by default)
- Graph presentation settings (zoom, scale mode, fixed max)
- Minimap button angle

Deleting `DingTimerDB` from your SavedVariables folder resets everything to defaults.

## Contributing

Bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests are welcome.

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b my-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
4. Push: `git push origin my-feature`
5. Open a pull request

Please include a description of what changed and why.

---

## Coverage

Run Lua coverage from repo root:

```powershell
.\coverage.ps1
```

The script prefers the `lua` / `luarocks` pair on `PATH` and falls back to the LocalAppData Lua install if needed. It generates `luacov.report.out` and `luacov.stats.out` in the project root.

---

## License

MIT — do whatever you want with it, just don't blame me if your /played skyrockets because you got addicted to optimizing your XP/hr.

---

*May your queues be short, your pulls be clean, and your XP/hr be ever upward.*
